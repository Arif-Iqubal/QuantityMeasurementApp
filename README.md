### UC8: Refactoring Unit Enum to Standalone with Conversion Responsibility
📅 (Date: 24-Feb-2026)

Refactored `LengthUnit` from a nested enum inside `QuantityLength` to a standalone top-level enum and delegated all conversion responsibilities to it, improving scalability and adhering to SOLID principles.

<br>Covered:
- Extracted `LengthUnit` as a standalone enum class (FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS)
- Implemented `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()` inside `LengthUnit`
- Removed internal conversion logic from `QuantityLength`
- Delegated all conversion, equality, and arithmetic operations to unit methods
- Eliminated circular dependency risk for future measurement categories
- Preserved all UC1–UC7 functionality without modifying client code
- Ensured strict validation for null units and invalid values
- Verified backward compatibility by running all previous test cases

<br>Outcome:
- Achieved Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) compliance
- Improved separation of concerns and reduced coupling
- Centralized conversion logic for better cohesion
- Established scalable architecture for future categories (WeightUnit, VolumeUnit, etc.)
- Maintained immutability, type safety, and mathematical correctness
- Successfully refactored without breaking existing APIs or test suites
