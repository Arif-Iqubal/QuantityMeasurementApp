### UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations on Quantity Measurements
📅 (Date: 26-Feb-2026)

Extended the generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` architecture to support **Subtraction** and **Division** across all measurement categories (Length, Weight, Volume).

<br>Covered:
- Implemented overloaded `subtract()` methods  
  - Implicit target unit (first operand’s unit)  
  - Explicit target unit specification  
- Implemented `divide()` method returning a dimensionless scalar (double)  
- Enabled cross-unit arithmetic (e.g., feet − inches, kg − grams, litre − mL)  
- Normalized operands through base unit before arithmetic  
- Added strict validation (null checks, finiteness, cross-category prevention)  
- Prevented division by zero (throws `ArithmeticException`)  
- Preserved immutability (operations return new objects)  
- Maintained rounding consistency (2 decimal places for Quantity results)  
- Verified non-commutativity of subtraction and division  
- Ensured compatibility with addition, equality, and conversion  

<br>Outcome:
- Quantity system now supports full arithmetic set: **add, subtract, divide**
- Generic design required **no structural refactoring**
- Architecture scales seamlessly across Length, Weight, and Volume
- SOLID principles maintained (SRP, OCP, DRY intact)
- Cross-category operations safely rejected at compile-time + runtime
- Demonstrated mathematical correctness (identity, inverse, non-commutativity)
- Confirmed immutability and functional-style operations
- Strengthened validation and fail-fast error handling

<br>🔎 SOLID / Design Validation:
- ✅ SRP maintained (Quantity handles arithmetic only)
- ✅ OCP maintained (new operations added without modifying enums)
- ✅ DRY preserved (shared base-unit normalization logic reused)
- ⚠️ Minor Improvement Area: If arithmetic logic grows further, extract shared private helper for base-unit arithmetic to avoid future duplication.
