### UC10: Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface (Multi-Category Support)
📅 (Date: 25-Feb-2026)

Refactored the architecture to introduce a single generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` class, eliminating duplication across category-specific classes and enabling scalable multi-category measurement support.

<br>Covered:
- Created `IMeasurable` interface defining unit conversion contract
- Refactored `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit` to implement `IMeasurable`
- Replaced `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` with generic `Quantity<U>`
- Implemented type-safe equality, conversion, and addition using bounded generics
- Prevented cross-category comparisons using compile-time and runtime checks
- Simplified `QuantityMeasurementApp` with unified generic demonstration methods
- Preserved all UC1–UC9 functionality without modifying existing tests
- Ensured immutability, hashCode consistency, and DRY compliance

<br>Outcome:
- Eliminated exponential code duplication across categories
- Achieved full adherence to SRP, DRY, OCP, and LSP principles
- Established scalable architecture for future categories (Volume, Temperature, Time, etc.)
- Reduced maintenance burden with single source of truth for operations
- Strengthened type safety through generics and interface-based design
- Validated performance neutrality with no runtime overhead from generics
