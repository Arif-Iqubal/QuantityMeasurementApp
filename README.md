### UC11: Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)
📅 (Date: 25-Feb-2026)

Extended the generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` architecture to support a third measurement category: **Volume**, without modifying any existing core classes.

<br>Covered:
- Created standalone `VolumeUnit` enum (LITRE, MILLILITRE, GALLON) implementing `IMeasurable`
- Defined base unit normalization using LITRE as the base unit
- Implemented accurate conversion factors (1 L = 1000 mL, 1 gal ≈ 3.78541 L)
- Verified equality comparison across units (L ↔ mL ↔ gallon)
- Validated conversion operations using generic `convertTo()` method
- Tested addition (implicit and explicit target unit) using generic `add()` methods
- Ensured cross-category safety (Volume ≠ Length ≠ Weight)
- Preserved immutability and epsilon-based floating-point tolerance
- Confirmed zero changes required in `Quantity<U>`, `IMeasurable`, or app structure

<br>Outcome:
- Proved UC10 generic design scales seamlessly to new categories
- Demonstrated true DRY compliance across three independent domains
- Validated architectural scalability without exponential code growth
- Maintained strict type safety using generics and runtime unit checks
- Ensured mathematical accuracy across all volume operations
- Established repeatable pattern for adding future categories (Temperature, Time, etc.)
