# 🚀 Quantity Measurement Application  
## 📏 Test-Driven Development (TDD) | OOP | Clean Code | DRY Principle  

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Quantity Measurement Application** is designed to validate equality, conversion, and arithmetic operations between different measurement units such as Feet, Inches, Yards, etc.

This project was implemented incrementally using:

- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ Feature Branch Workflow
- ✅ Clean Code Practices
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
- ✅ Proper Unit Conversion Strategy

### UC1: Feet Measurement Equality
📅 (Date: 20-Feb-2026)

Implemented equality comparison for two feet measurement values using proper object-oriented design and Java equality contract principles.

<br>Covered:
- Designed `QuantityMeasurementApp` with an immutable inner `Feet` class
- Applied encapsulation using `private final double value`
- Overrode `equals()` method following reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, and null-safe rules
- Used `Double.compare()` for precise floating-point comparison instead of `==`
- Implemented null checks and type safety using `getClass()`
- Wrote unit tests covering same value, different value, null comparison, and same reference scenarios

<br>Outcome:
- Strengthened understanding of object equality and value-based comparison
- Improved knowledge of immutability, null safety, and clean OOP design in Java

### UC2: Feet and Inches Measurement Equality
📅 (Date: 21-Feb-2026)

Extended UC1 to support equality comparison for both Feet and Inches measurements while treating them as separate entities.

<br>Covered:
- Implemented a separate `Inches` class similar to the `Feet` class
- Compared inch-to-inch and feet-to-feet values independently
- Created static methods to reduce dependency on the main method
- Applied encapsulation using `private final double value` in both classes
- Overrode `equals()` method in both classes following Java Equality Contract
- Used `Double.compare()` for accurate floating-point comparison
- Ensured null checking and strict type safety using `getClass()`
- Wrote unit tests covering same value, different value, null comparison, non-numeric input, and same reference scenarios

<br>Outcome:
- Strengthened understanding of value-based equality across multiple unit types
- Practiced reusable equality logic with proper OOP principles
- Identified DRY principle violation due to duplicate logic in Feet and Inches classes
- Understood the need for a better design using a common `Quantity` class or unit parameterization
