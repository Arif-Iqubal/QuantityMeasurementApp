### UC1: Feet Measurement Equality
📅 (Date: 20-Feb-2026)

Implemented equality comparison for two feet measurement values using proper object-oriented design and Java equality contract principles.

<br>Covered:
- Designed `QuantityMeasurementApp` with an immutable inner `Feet` class
- Applied encapsulation using `private final double value`
- Overrode `equals()` method following reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, and null-safe rules
- Used `Double.compare()` for precise floating-point comparison instead of `==`
- Implemented null checks and type safety using `getClass()`
- Wrote unit tests covering same value, different value, null comparison, and same reference scenarios

<br>Outcome:
- Strengthened understanding of object equality and value-based comparison
- Improved knowledge of immutability, null safety, and clean OOP design in Java
