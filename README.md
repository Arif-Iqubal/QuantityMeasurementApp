### UC9: Weight Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition (Kilogram, Gram, Pound)
📅 (Date: 24-Feb-2026)

Extended the Quantity Measurement Application to support a new measurement category: **Weight**, implementing equality, conversion, and addition operations for Kilogram, Gram, and Pound units.

<br>Covered:
- Created standalone `WeightUnit` enum (KILOGRAM, GRAM, POUND) with base unit normalization (kilogram)
- Implemented `QuantityWeight` class mirroring `QuantityLength` design
- Added equality comparison using base unit (kg) normalization with epsilon tolerance
- Implemented `convertTo()` method supporting all weight unit pairs
- Added overloaded `add()` methods (implicit and explicit target unit support)
- Ensured strict category type safety (weight ≠ length)
- Overrode `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for value-object correctness
- Preserved immutability (all operations return new instances)
- Maintained backward compatibility with UC1–UC8

<br>Outcome:
- Successfully scaled architecture to multiple measurement categories
- Validated reusable design pattern across Length and Weight
- Ensured mathematical correctness in cross-unit weight operations
- Strengthened understanding of enum-based conversion responsibility
- Achieved strong separation of concerns and category isolation
- Confirmed architectural readiness for future categories (Volume, Temperature, etc.)
